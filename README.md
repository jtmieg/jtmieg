-Our names are Danielle and Jean THierry-Mieg
- We are membersof the CBB computational biology branch.
We have been working on the worm and human genome project since the beginning as part of the Cambridge St-Louis collaboration.
We joined NCBI in 2001 to work on the gene annotations and maintain the NCBI/AceView website which presents an integrative gene 
annotation based on RNA-seq data.
With Tom Madden and Greg Boratyn, we developped the Magic-BLAST aligner, which gives precise spliced alignments of RNA to genome, even 
of not too distant species, and deals well with long reads from PacBio and Nanopore. 

This repository contains the source code of the AceView system which is built around and integrates the acedb object oriented database manager,
the magic aligner (now integrated in magic-BLAST) and a large variety of codes to allow integrative analysis of thousands of RNA-seq experiments.
differential expression analysis, SNP search, and a very detailled quality conttrol.

We are also members of the MAQC/SEQC collaboration, an FDA led assesment of the massive sequencing techniques and micro arrays. 

By training, Danielle is a geneticist and molecular biologist and Jean a mathematician and theoretical physicist
still active in quantum field theory and differential geometry (see arxiv). 

This repository also contains private projects dealing with Quantum Field Theory (QFT) and Neural-Nets (NN). Please mail us if you are interested : jeanielle.mieg@gmail.com  or mieg@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
